# 🔐 Dorcas Olujimi - Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. Each project demonstrates real-world problem solving in detection, prevention, response, and risk management.

I’m building this portfolio systematically over 12 weeks. Each project is linked below as it goes live.

## 🚀 Portfolio Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 – Foundations 
1. [SIEM Threat Detection Lab](https://github.com/jimidorcas/siem-threat-detection-lab) ✅
   → Because brute-force logins, suspicious processes, and unusual network traffic are common attacker techniques, I built a Splunk SIEM lab to simulate how SOC teams detect these threats. I ingested system logs, wrote detection queries (SPL), and built dashboards to flag malicious behavior.
2. [Vulnerability Scanning & Remediation Lab (Nmap, OpenVAS, Python)](https://github.com/jimidorcas/vulnerability-scanning-lab) ✅
   → I used Nmap and OpenVAS to scan a test system and found outdated Apache and weak SSH configs — both common real-world vulnerabilities. I documented remediation steps (patches, config changes) aligned with CIS Benchmarks, and wrote a Python script to automate parsing scan results and flag risky ports. 
3. [Incident Response Playbook – Phishing → Malware](https://github.com/jimidorcas/incident-response-playbooks) 
   → Since phishing often leads to malware infections, I created an IR Playbook that guides teams through Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover phases. I expanded the repo to include ransomware, insider threat, and BEC scenarios, providing escalation workflows and remediation guide

### ⏳ Phase 2 – 
4. [Threat Hunting with Logs (Splunk, Sysmon)]([link-coming-soon])
   → Attackers often persist by creating scheduled tasks, abusing PowerShell, or clearing event logs. I simulated these behaviours in a lab and wrote SPL queries to hunt them, mapping detections to MITRE ATT&CK. This project shows how analysts can proactively detect threats before alerts even trigger.  
5. Cyberattack Investigation & Report  
   → Investigate a simulated ransomware/phishing attack and deliver a client-ready report.  
6. Risk Assessment Matrix  
   → Build a likelihood × impact risk matrix for SME cyber threats.  

---

### ⏳ Phase 3 – 
7. Security Gap Analysis Report  
   → Assess a fictional SME’s current vs. desired security posture (ISO 27001 / NIST CSF).  
8. Security Awareness Campaign (Dept-Specific)  
   → Awareness toolkit (slides, checklist, quiz) for Finance or Remote Workers.  
9. Executive Dashboard – Cybersecurity KPIs  
   → Mock KPI dashboard for phishing attempts, MTTR, training %, patch compliance.
