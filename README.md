# 🔐 Dorcas Olujimi - Cybersecurity Portfolio


Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!    

I’m building this portfolio systematically over 12 weeks. Each project is linked below as it goes live.

## 🚀 Portfolio Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 – Foundations (SOC Skills)
1. [SIEM Threat Detection Lab](https://github.com/jimidorcas/siem-threat-detection-lab) ✅
   → Because brute-force logins, suspicious processes, and unusual network traffic are common attacker techniques, I built a Splunk SIEM lab to simulate how SOC teams detect these threats. I ingested system logs, wrote detection queries (SPL), and built dashboards to flag malicious behavior. This project demonstrates how analysts identify and respond to early signs of compromise in real-world environments.
2. [Phishing Email Analysis (Python)](link-coming-soon)  
   → Parse phishing emails, extract IOCs, and automate red-flag detection.  
3. [Incident Response Playbook – Phishing → Malware](link-coming-soon)  
   → IR workflow aligned with NIST CSF, including escalation & comms templates.

### ⏳ Phase 2 – Applied SOC Work
4. Threat Hunting with Logs  
   → Hunt persistence techniques (registry mods, scheduled tasks) using Sysmon/Suricata logs.  
5. Cyberattack Investigation & Report  
   → Investigate a simulated ransomware/phishing attack and deliver a client-ready report.  
6. Risk Assessment Matrix  
   → Build a likelihood × impact risk matrix for SME cyber threats.  

---

### ⏳ Phase 3 – Consultancy Strength
7. Security Gap Analysis Report  
   → Assess a fictional SME’s current vs. desired security posture (ISO 27001 / NIST CSF).  
8. Security Awareness Campaign (Dept-Specific)  
   → Awareness toolkit (slides, checklist, quiz) for Finance or Remote Workers.  
9. Executive Dashboard – Cybersecurity KPIs  
   → Mock KPI dashboard for phishing attempts, MTTR, training %, patch compliance.
